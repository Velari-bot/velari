## Payment Integration Workflow

### 1. Customer Makes Payment
Customer completes payment through Stripe or PayPal in a ticket.

### 2. Admin Verifies Payment
Admin receives payment confirmation and uses `/addorder`:
```
/addorder user:@customer order_id:STRIPE_123456 service:Website Development payment_method:stripe amount:$200.00 notes:Landing page with contact form
```

### 3. Customer Gets Confirmation
Customer receives DM with:
- Order confirmation
- Order ID for tracking
- Instructions to use `/trackorder`

### 4. Order Progress Updates
Admin updates order status as work progresses:
```
/updateorder order_id:STRIPE_123456 status:In Progress notes:Design phase complete, starting development
```

### 5. Customer Tracks Progress
Customer uses `/trackorder order_id:STRIPE_123456` to see:
- Current status
- Progress bar
- Staff assignments
- Latest notes

## Database Structure

Orders are stored in Firebase with the following fields:

```javascript
{
  orderId: "STRIPE_123456",
  userId: "123456789",
  username: "customer#1234",
  service: "Website Development",
  paymentMethod: "stripe",
  amount: "$200.00",
  notes: "Landing page with contact form",
  status: "Payment Verified",
  timestamp: Date,
  addedBy: "admin_id",
  addedByUsername: "admin#5678",
  lastUpdated: Date,
  updatedBy: "admin_id",
  updatedByUsername: "admin#5678",
  staff: "developer_id",
  staffUsername: "developer#9012"
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Admins
1. **Always verify payments** before adding orders
2. **Use descriptive notes** when updating status
3. **Assign staff** to orders for accountability
4. **Update status promptly** as work progresses
5. **Use consistent order IDs** from payment systems

### For Customers
1. **Save your order ID** from the confirmation DM
2. **Use `/trackorder`** to check progress
3. **Contact support** if you have questions
4. **Provide feedback** when order is complete

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Ticket System
- Orders created through tickets get automatic order IDs
- Ticket channels include order ID in topic
- Support can reference order IDs in ticket discussions

### Review System
- Completed orders qualify users for review system
- Use `/assignrole` to give purchased role after order completion

### Key System
- Orders can be linked to key generation
- Use order IDs to track key deliveries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
